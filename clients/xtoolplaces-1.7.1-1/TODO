Future plans (in no particular order):
-------------------------------------
1.  Get the border size used by the running window manager and adjust the
    values of the window geometry accordingly (suggested by John R. Johns II)

    [ed note: I think xtoolplaces already compensates for the window manager
     border size.  Unless somebody tells me something different, I won't bother
     with this one]
