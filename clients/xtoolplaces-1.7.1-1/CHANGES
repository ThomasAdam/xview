From 1.7 (patchlevel 7) -> 1.7.1 (patchlevel 8):
-----------------------------------------------
  - Added ability to ignore all CDE dt* applications (i.e. dtcalc, dtmail,
    etc.).  This can be set either using the "-idt" command line option,
    or the ".ignoredt" X resource setting. (suggested by Denis Beauchemin)

  - Changed looking for dtterm by matching the class name against "Dtterm"
    (the old way of looking at the name fails when using the -name arg when
     starting dtterm) (suggested by Denis Beauchemin)

  - When checking a window against the ignore and missing lists, BOTH the
    name and class is checked, not just the name. (suggested by Denis
    Beauchemin)

  - Moved the checking to see if the window is on the ignore list forward
    so that if it is, no processing on that window is done at all.  This
    prevents xtoolplaces from crashing Lotus Notes. (suggested by Denis
    Beauchemin)

From 1.6 (patchlevel 6) -> 1.7 (patchlevel 7):
---------------------------------------------
  - Fixed to enable running under CDE v1.2 (and perhaps other versions)
    [The terminal windows were causing Xtoolplaces to wait indefinitely
     on the call to XNextEvent()]

  - Added lines in the Imakefile and Makefile.simple files to bring in
    strdup() and strstr() if needed.  By default, they are not compiled in
    and the OS version is used.  Hopefully, this will stop Linux users from
    having problems with different function prototypes since they don't
    need xtoolplaces's versions of these functions.

  - Fixed potential bug where getting the command line of a program returns
    a successful status, but there are no arguments

  - Changed Imakefile/Makefile.simple to use gcc as the default compiler and
    changed the settings to allow compiling on Solaris (rather than SunOS).

From 1.5 (patchlevel 5) -> 1.6 (patchlevel 6):
-----------------------------------------------

  - Fixed command line to escape pound signs (change supplied by John R.
    Johns II)

  - Xtoolplaces wouldn't match any arguments when it was called with a
    leading path (i.e. ./xtoolplaces).  This is now fixed.

  - Added ability to specify a list of windows to ignore (and so they are
    NOT saved) (suggested by Hermann Kneissel).  This file can be specified
    via the "-i" command line switch or by the "xtoolplaces.ignore" X resource
    setting.

From 1.4a (patchlevel 4a) -> 1.5 (patchlevel 5):
-----------------------------------------------
  - Added option "-w" to use "xtoolwait", a Sun OpenWindows "toolwait"
    look-alike.  Command line option is "-w" and X-resource
    "xtoolplaces.toolwait" (change supplied by Richard Huveneers)

  - Added option to use other programs than "xtoolwait".  Command line
    option is "-p" and X-resource "xtoolplaces.toolwaitprog".  Also
    edited the manual a little to reflect the new options and
    resources (change supplied by Richard Huveneers)

  - Strip the program name of any leading path information (change supplied
    by Peter Bollerman)

  - Fixed bug in strip_arg2() where the string position was being
    calculated one position too far foward (change supplied by John R.
    Johns II)

  - Fixed removing of icon geometry from command line (change supplied by
    John R. Johns II)

  - Fixed up declaring of system function prototypes in xtoolplaces.h,
    changed to declare index()/rindex() macros for those people with
    System 5 string functions instead of doing #ifdef's everywhere
    index()/rindex() is being used.

From 1.4 (patchlevel 4) -> 1.4a (patchlevel 4a):
-----------------------------------------------
  - In Xtoolplaces.ad, changed the default remote command to "rsh -n" (from
    just "rsh")

  - Modified to compile under X11R6.  Instead of finding out which X server
    xtoolplaces is running under (R6 didn't seem to have the structure field
    I was using), it is assumed to be 0

From 1.3.1 (patchlevel 3.1) -> 1.4 (patchlevel 4):
---------------------------------------------------
  - took out an unneeded include file so that it compiles (and works)
    for X11R4 and X11R5 (I don't know about R6) (suggested by Donn Morrill)

  - Added vroot.h to handle mwm and tvtwm.  Haven't tested this with
    tvtwm, but I have with MOTIF.  (suggested by Lars Huttar, Jonathan
    Brazier)

  - Modifed to handle EMACS 19 (this will probably break working with
    older versions) (brought to my attention by John Hempe)

  - Fixed handling of xterm's scrollbars (-sb and -b) options so that
    the correct geometry is calculated (brought to my attention by
    Roar Smith)

  - Fixed various compiler problems such as having register variables
    and taking the address of that variable, illegal pointer argument
    to malloc(), and not including <ctype.h> (various compile bugs
    brought to my attention by Tom McConnell, Hermann Kneissel, John
    Tillema, Pete Lancashire, Joe Kiniry)

  - Took out unneeded (I think) XFree() calls.  I was sending an
    illegal argument in the first place.  I don't think I need them
    since the variable in question had no allocated (by any alloc()
    routine) space.  (illegal arguments to these XFree() calls
    brought to my attention by Kevin Fisher, Hermann Kneissel, John
    Tillema, Pete Lancashire, Joe Kiniry)

  - Added support for NCRArchitecture in Imakefile and Makefile.
    If this is defined, additional libraries will be on the link
    line (suggested by Tom McConnell)

  - Fixed the problem of the remote program variable being NULL
    (brought to my attention by Tom McConnell)

  - Added "#define <sys/time.h>" so that xtoolplaces compiles
    under SYSV4 without problems.  I have no idea why SYSV4
    would need this, this was suggested (suggested by
    Hermann Kneissel)

  - Modified to work with System 5 as far as not having a
    gethostname() function and having strchr()/strrchr()
    instead of index()/rindex() (changes supplied by John Tillema)

  - CodeCenterized

From 1.3 (patchlevel 3) -> 1.3.1 (patchlevel 3.1):
-------------------------------------------------

  - Changed the adding of geometry options to be the first
    options as opposed to adding them onto the end.  This is
    especially needed for programs that have an option that
    needs to go at the end (i.e. xterm's -e option).  (brought
    to my attention by etj90)

From 1.2 (patchlevel 2) -> 1.3 (patchlevel 3):
---------------------------------------------

  - Fixed compile bugs as reported by gcc.  Add gcc support in
    Imakefile and Makefile.simple (they are commented out).
    (compile bugs brought to my addention by Michael Salmon,
    Chung Tin Kwok, Simon Leinen, Nelson Minar, Malcolm C.
    Strickland)

  - Fixed bug which caused xtoolplaces to core dump (when
    epoch is around).  (brought to my attention by Ted
    Rodriguez-Bell).

From 1.2 Beta (patchlevel 1) -> 1.2 Final (patchlevel 2):
--------------------------------------------------------
  - Added support for emacs (source code supplied by Kresten).

  - Added support for xconsole (suggested by Matthias Pfuetzner).

  - The function strdup() was added for systems that don't have
    it (brought to my attention by Renato).

  - Put double quotes around options with whitespace in them
    (brought to my attention by Larry W. Virden).

From 1.1 Beta (patchlevel 1) -> 1.2 Beta (patchlevel 1):
-------------------------------------------------------

  - Added checking of a null WM_COMMAND (Filemgr's wastebasket
    and Mailtool's Compose window) (problem found by Larry E.
    Wagner).

From 1.0 -> 1.1 Beta (patchlevel 1):
-----------------------------------

  - Added handling of resources as defined in Volume One,
    Xlib Programming Manual, p. 346 (suggested by Larry W.
    Virden).

  - Fixed bug in fix_command(), didn't take into account that
    X positions can have + and - signs in them.
